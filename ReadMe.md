# Electrocardiogram Simulator

This program was created using the LabWindows/CVI from National Instruments (NI).
It is designed to monitor the heart rate and diagnose ECG for abnormalities.These include detecting Bradycardia, Tachycardia, Ventricular Tachycardia, S-T interval\n elevation and decline as well as Bigeminus.The program is also able to plot the Vectorcardiogram of the acquired ECG

* Use the files given "Data Files used in File Mode" for using "File_Mode" .The files are dummy ecg signals generated using a ecg function generator in order to test the program.

* You can also use the Data Acquisition Mode "DAQ Mode" for acquiring data in realtime from ECG leads using a National Instruments DAQ card.

* The Plot VCG button plots the Vectorcardiogram using the ecg signals.

The program is just a learning tool and is not a replacement actual ECG. It SHOULD NOT be used for diagnosing and treating medical disorders. The author of the code won't be responsible for any type of loss caused by this the use of this software.

Please report any bugs to @darshanmandge.
